This repo was originally hosted at github.com/tim-salabim but moved here as this is somewhat the birthplace of github.com/r-spatial see https://github.com/r-spatial/rspatial_spark/issues/9 for the entire discussion.

### What is this about?

This repo is meant as a brainstorming place for collecting ideas and requirements for advancing spatial analysis workflow in R. The ultimate aim is, in my opinion, to enable a complete workflow for the day-to-day stuff from disk storage (I/O) via (interactive) data manipulation to final presentation without the need to open external software. I am hopeful that with this discussion document we can identify and address some open questions around streamlining steps/modules/packages necessary for providing a full blown r spatial analysis portfolio.

If you want to contribute, either sumit a pull request or comment in issue #1 and I will add you as a collaborator with push rights. Please feel free to invite others to partake. This is an open discussion so the more the merrier.

The format is currently completely open, everyone should ideally fill in the blanks where they think they can contribute/have something to say.

I would suggest to treat the central document (rspatial_roadmap) as a collection of abstracts with elaborated views provided in other documents referred to in the core document.
